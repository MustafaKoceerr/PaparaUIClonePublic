# Papara Clone App

- Papara mobile application's UI clone
- You can find all the screens and a video about how the app works in the "screen" folder. Don't forget to take a look!
## 	:book: Description :
Since I cloned Papara's screen, I took the drawables from Papara. The copyrights belong to them. That's why I couldn't push the drawables. So, the project won't work due to missing drawables, but you can still review my code.

In This Project: 
- After the user logs in, they can save the token.
- If the user is registered, they only need to enter their password when logging in again.
- After the user logs in, they can use the token in the header to make API requests.
- The user can view their expenses.
- The "MVVM Pattern" is used.
- The "Single Activity Pattern" is used thanks to the navigation library.

- Hey! I'm continuing to develop the project.
- New screens will be added (it might be done using Compose after learning it).
- Existing screens can be made more modular.
